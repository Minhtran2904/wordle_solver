# wordle_solver
A fun attempt to make a solver for the game wordle

Introduction of how the solver works:
1. start guessing
2. input "result" into program with correct format: y for yellow, g for green and w for grey or wrong guess.
3. program will return list of possible words left
4. pick one word from the list and repeat from step 1.

Example: From [website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
